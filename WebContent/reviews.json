,   "description"  :  "imagine putting both addams family movies together , adding a heap of sexual innuendo , and placing the effects of men in black on top of it . now imagine taking the dry wit out of all these movies , adding an extreme amount of violence , ethnical slurs , and push-up bras . wild wild west , a new creation of barry sonnenfeld , director of get shorty and men in black tries to make it work . . . it doesnt . exactly whose fault it is is yet to be determined , so let me just give you an outline . james west ( smith , who still fits the superhero role nicely , but hes horribly miscast ) is teamed up with effects specialist artemus gordon ( kline , who puts on that fancy-pants know-it-all thing that worked in in & out , but not here ) to save president grant from an 80-foot tarantula created by arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh , who , im ashamed to say , should stick with helena bonham carter and shakespeare ) hes using to take over the entire us government turning the northwest into loveliss land . now this could be an original premise , but the film is so darned contrived that you know will smith will win in the end . whereas , arlington road ( a better action/paranoia thriller by about , oh , * * or * * * stars ) had a suprising explosive ending that you couldnt see coming until the very end , this ones obvious at about the 30-minute point . i believe that the filmmakers realized this , so they decided to make the film more fun by adding cool gadgets , heaps of jokes about breasts , tons of violence ( an extreme amount for a pg-13 movie ) and racial and ethnic slurs that sound like their coming from episodes of jerry springer and american history x . this film is not for children and parents should be very cautious about taking them to it . i actually believe that a child would benefit much more from seeing south park : bigger , longer , and uncut , arlington road , or maybe even american pie . thus , i give wild wild west ( the worst movie of the year so far along with virus ) * 1/2 stars ."

,   "description"  :  "in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa . the twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government . after being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest . when the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isnt alone . many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . that brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt . however , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement . after betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight . until that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon . unfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script . sometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldnt be . on the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl . on the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible . however , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldnt be the total waste of time ."

,   "description"  :  " krippendorfs tribe is a formula comedy . done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorfs tribe , that actually works . professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . however , he found . . . nothing . his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . krippendorfs tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . though theres some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the films latter scenes is superb . richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . jenna elfmans position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : its funny . it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs ."

,   "description"  :  "capsule : jackie chan teams up with his old buddy sammo hung to give us another zero-calorie fight-fest . gloriously foolish fun . my wife had this to say about mr . nice guy :   as entertainment , its great . as a movie , it sucks .   i was forced to agree : the plot was an afterthought , the acting was hopeless , the script a throwaway . but it showcased jackie chans raucous physical comedy --   martial arts   is the wrong word for it -- and was therefore more than worth it . it isnt the all-out roar of joy that rumble in the bronx and especially supercop were , but its still great fun . most movies that feature martial-arts action are about the giving and receiving of violent pain . jackie has a slightly goofier agenda , and is all the better for it -- even if hes in a paper-thin story . the plot ( what a word ! ) : jackie is a tv chef living in australia who specializes in on-screen acrobatics with his food . one day he collides with a journalist whos just filmed a drug deal that ended in violence , and theres a mix-up of tapes . this of course puts him right in the path of an endless stream of punks , henchmen , cigar-smoking baddies , and cops . thats about it-- but ther are a host of tiny little departures , like his girlfriend ( miki lee ) and his female assistant , who have a howlingly funny scene that , due to language barriers , cannot be repeated here . some things you gotta see to believe . jackies stuntwork needs a new vocabulary to describe it : its like play , or maybe a kind of dance . one scene has jackie getting into a fight in traffic -- on top of a flood of pepsi cans . another scene involves an unfinished building and a whole maze of doors opening into empty rooms and corridors . hung ( who directed ) plays it like an homage to the road runner and wile e . coyote cartoons . ( hung also films things a little more loosely and fluidly than staney tong did : we get a lot of steadicam work , lots of things going on in different sectors of the screen . ) another , even more mind-boggling scene , involves jackie being forced to fight with henchmen holding his limbs back with bungee cords . ( yes , he manages to get the upper hand with that one as well . dont ask how . ) the final scene gives us the grand guignol ( sans blood ) ending that a movie like this deserves . heres a hint : in the first five minutes , we see a giant earth-moving vehicle used to bury someone . seeing a thing like that in a movie like this is ( to quote roger ebert ) like camille coughing in the first reel and not dying in the last : it * has * to make an encore . i was right . only this time , jackie was driving ."

( columbia tristar ) director : mic rodgers stars : jean-claude van damme , michael jai white , bill goldberg , daniel von bargen , kiana tom , justin lazard . jean-claude van damme reprises his character of luc devereaux , the regenerated soldier , for this risible second sequel to 1992s violent futuristic thriller universal soldier . van damme was absent from the dire 1998 sequel universal soldier ii brothers in arms , in which his character was played by another performer . that film disappeared straight to video in this country . van dammes return doesnt necessarily herald an improvement in quality , but it does ensure that universal soldier : the return gains a brief cinema release before disappearing into the same video wilderness that has claimed most of his recent lacklustre efforts . with the end of the cold war , the military is drastically reducing its budget . the first cutbacks affect the futuristic unisol project , in which dead soldiers are regenerated and turned into virtually indestructible cyborgs . but seth , the super-intelligent computer responsible for much of the unisol project , rebels against the governments plans , and seizes control of the soldiers . seth manages to assume human form ( martial arts star michael jai white ) and lead his invincible troops as they take over the top secret complex that houses the unisol project . as a stand-off develops between the regular army and the cyborgs it falls to devereaux to try and stop seths plans . mic rodgers , a former stunt co-ordinator who has worked on films including titanic and lethal weapon 4 , makes his directorial debut here . he handles the action and pyrotechnics effectively enough , but he lacks the flair and visual style of original creators roland emmerich and dean devlin . universal soldier the return lacks the energy and spectacularly staged action sequences of the original . this highly unlikely scenario uses the original provocative theme purely as an excuse for lots of testosterone-fuelled action , loud explosions , gratuitous mayhem , formulaic and mindless carnage . whereas the original managed to pit van damme against fellow action star dolph lundgren , the best this dire sequel can do is pit our uncharismatic muscle bound hero against bill goldberg , the popular wrestler , whose woeful , one-dimensional performance takes the craft of screen acting to a new low . universal soldier the return is a far cry from van dammes superior action thrillers like time cop and sudden death , and further demonstrates just how far his career has fallen . the scene in which his character complains that he doesnt want to be stereotyped resonates with an unintentional irony . this is one return that is both unnecessary and unwelcome .

,   "description"  :   "if there has been a better comedy of errors this year than id reccomend it be shown with this delightful french import from the director of la cage aux folles . it could be a laugh all day film festival , because thats exactly what this movie is . what seems like the french   bean   turns out to be an even more hilarious romp . this movie will have you laughing for days after , and im glad im able to share this review with you . a man is on a train with francois pignon ( villeret ) when he begins to pull out pictures of different things he has built out of matches . guess how many matches it took ? he asks , 364 , 422 ! pierre is charmed , because hes found an idiot for his friend pierre brochant ( lhermitte . ) every wednesday they invite an idiot to have dinner in order to make fun of him all evening . tonight its his turn , and before now , he was idiotless . plus , this guy is in a class of his own . pierre cracks his back while playing golf , the doctor tells him not to go to the dinner for his better health but since his idiot is the cream of the crop he attempts to go anyway . then his wife christine ( alexandra vandernoot ) decides to leave him for his cruelty for others . he thinks hes gone to the man he stole her from , then decides shes at a local love club . but in order get the phone number there they have to call a tax auditor . the idiot worsens pierres back problems and screws up any of his chances of getting back together with his wife . a complex plot is soon laid out in the household . another film from veber that is full to the brim with original comic ideas . name one comedy that takes happens in one place , in a foreign language , and that is incredibly funny . one of the best parts about the dinner game ( besides that cool looking animation that showcases the titles and credits for the film ) is the fact that while its called the dinner game , there is no dinner or no game at all . the films comedy owes almost everything to villeret , hes someone you can just look at and laugh . when the film is remade in the us ( with robin williams as the idiot ) it will probably lose all of the charm and the wit that is featured here . the supporting cast is good , but its obvious whos in the center of attention . so , go see the dinner game while you can , this funny , original , and interesting french comedy gets  stars ."

,   "description"  :   "okay , let me first say , this is a beavis and butthead movie . if you do not like beavis and butthead , do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! ! however , if you do like them , i recommened you get out right now and go see it . the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv . they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it . this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) . they look for her because as they are searching for the tv , they find a drunk who wants them   to do   his wife . well , of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her . and the fun starts their . this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off . it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy . i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace . even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag , he manages to keep the laughs coming . if you expecting changes from the show keep looking . the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and thats what makes it good . you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things . often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place !"

,   "description"  :   "written by : francis ford coppola , adapted from the novel by john grisham starring : matt damon , claire danes , danny devito , jon voight , and danny glover ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . rudys girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudys elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudys friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldnt pay for a bone marrow transplant . rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance companys team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . will rudy defeat leo ? will he enjoy being a lawyer ? opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . in the typical lawyer movie theres one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . however , coppolas movie is deliberately more low key . the rainmaker plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . in the background rudys voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . first , rudys time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . also , rudys use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age ."

,   "description"  :  "capsule : jackie chan teams up with his old buddy sammo hung to give us another zero-calorie fight-fest . gloriously foolish fun . my wife had this to say about mr . nice guy :   as entertainment , its great . as a movie , it sucks .   i was forced to agree : the plot was an afterthought , the acting was hopeless , the script a throwaway . but it showcased jackie chans raucous physical comedy --   martial arts   is the wrong word for it -- and was therefore more than worth it . it isnt the all-out roar of joy that rumble in the bronx and especially supercop were , but its still great fun . most movies that feature martial-arts action are about the giving and receiving of violent pain . jackie has a slightly goofier agenda , and is all the better for it -- even if hes in a paper-thin story . the plot ( what a word ! ) : jackie is a tv chef living in australia who specializes in on-screen acrobatics with his food . one day he collides with a journalist whos just filmed a drug deal that ended in violence , and theres a mix-up of tapes . this of course puts him right in the path of an endless stream of punks , henchmen , cigar-smoking baddies , and cops . thats about it-- but ther are a host of tiny little departures , like his girlfriend ( miki lee ) and his female assistant , who have a howlingly funny scene that , due to language barriers , cannot be repeated here . some things you gotta see to believe . jackies stuntwork needs a new vocabulary to describe it : its like play , or maybe a kind of dance . one scene has jackie getting into a fight in traffic -- on top of a flood of pepsi cans . another scene involves an unfinished building and a whole maze of doors opening into empty rooms and corridors . hung ( who directed ) plays it like an homage to the road runner and wile e . coyote cartoons . ( hung also films things a little more loosely and fluidly than staney tong did : we get a lot of steadicam work , lots of things going on in different sectors of the screen . ) another , even more mind-boggling scene , involves jackie being forced to fight with henchmen holding his limbs back with bungee cords . ( yes , he manages to get the upper hand with that one as well . dont ask how . ) the final scene gives us the grand guignol ( sans blood ) ending that a movie like this deserves . heres a hint : in the first five minutes , we see a giant earth-moving vehicle used to bury someone . seeing a thing like that in a movie like this is ( to quote roger ebert ) like camille coughing in the first reel and not dying in the last : it * has * to make an encore . i was right . only this time , jackie was driving ."

,   "description"  :"somewhere between big-budget action films and small-budget morality tales exists judgement night , a constantly exciting , always tense urban thriller about kids on the run . and no matter how you feel about foot-chase movies , or shoot-out movies ( or even movies that seldom show you the light of day ) , * this * movie is never less than engaging at any time . we first meet frank wyatt , a family man whose wife thinks he should stop hanging out with the guys who  have the hormones of teenagers  and start being around adults more . but frank hasnt been out of the house in a long while and he thinks he needs a breather . so , he tells his wife he loves her , kisses his babys head ( just like any devoted father and husband should ) , and is off with his best friends for a night out . next , are mike , ray , and franks brother ( whom he never , ever gets along with ) john . they all congregate in a van/bus , and are off to watch boxing in downtown chicago . wouldnt you know , traffics too damn slow , and ray decides to get off the main highway for a short detour . and wouldnt you know , they find themselves in a part of town none of them has ever seen before . ray is determined to get them to the boxing match on time , but then a funny thing happens-- he hits some guy on the run from bad guys . the guys try to help out this stranger theyve nearly killed , but before you know it the bad guys show up and retrieve the strange man . enter fallon ( played by denis leary ) , a drug kingpin/mobster/whatever who pulls a gun and murders the man in cold blood .  rule number one : do not steal from me ,  fallon states to his band of henchmen .  rule number two , no witnesses .  and so it goes , as this action-adventure is set into nonstop motion . given the amount of time this film in on the screen , and the number of long encounters which take place , not much time is allowed for much character development . so , there isnt any ( except if you count a whiner/wimp who only shows his true colors when its too late ) . then again , developing characters who provide the grounds for a story that just about leaves you breathless , and nothing more , would be a waste of time , especially when the action is as good as it is here . we get fights in the sewers , on and off trains , in low-rent apartment buildings , and even ( the finale ) in a small shopping mall downtown . and each sequence has a distinct feel to it , and each is inventive enough to make you feel as though you havent seen any of this before . the script , by lewis colick , is extremely derivative in its ways of executing action and suspense , and the score , by alan silvestri , ( when it can be heard through all the fantastic rap music ) sets a nice tone for what you see . director stephen hopkins , of predator ii fame , does what he couldnt do in that film with this one : make it credible enough for us to want to continue watching . true , this isnt a classical piece of cinema , but it does just what it needs to : stay on the screen as long as it needs to be there ( no longer , and no less ) , and excite us while we watch ."

,   "description"  :  " boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other   martial arts   flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lees skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - oharra , hans brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lees sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lees acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . im not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply cant avoid to appreciate the difference from todays movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who dont like that particular genre .

,   "description"  :  "from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of floridas south coast . plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . as the story unfolds , we find that many things arent exactly as they seem ( thats as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes   one too many   twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even   explained   many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her   good girl stereotypical   role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywoods jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants neednt lead to lawsuits . bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . sprinkle the story with a bunch o shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and youve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , i almost forgot bill murrays exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( shes also born in guelph , ontario . . . go hoser ! ) director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called   six degrees of kevin bacon "

,   "description"  :  "dogma -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring linda fiorentino , matt damon , ben affleck , chris rock written and directed by kevin smith linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogmas lead is nothing short of inexplicable . shes still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker whos lost her faith . one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethanys bedroom . he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the   prophets   jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smiths films thus far . at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black )   thirteenth apostle   , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . its a wild ride . theyre in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . its a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks ,   how corrupt are you ?   . wings of desire this aint . since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . ( chris rock is this films only weak link-between jokes , hes wooden . ) his no-frills visual style hasnt changed much over the years , though ( dogmas widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogmas pacing goes slack . a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when weve heard enough . because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to lokis bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan   catholicism wow !   ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . its a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christs , martin scorseses 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the pictures content but to rumours and heresy . theres a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . ( not one of them had watched it . ) every single person refused . smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smiths bethany and scorseses jesus are hollow shells without their faith . in fact , dogmas denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown thats worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . ( i felt sentimental about a religion i dont belong to . now thats powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . its enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way theyre attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . i therefore feel that , although im no bible-thumper , im at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers ."

,   "description"  :  "apt pupil  -a review by bill chambers ( wchamber@netcom . ca ) ( visit my review archive , play some movie trivia , and more  one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movies themes . while hardly a great film , singers ambitious adaptation of kings short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todds theory . bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowdens intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todds desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his   student   , among other things . bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source materials excessive climax . singer has yet to get keyser sze out of his system . his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbals tics and todds golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singers handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . mckellans and renfros performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellans finely-tuned realization , id like to single out renfros daring work . he isnt afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldnt do . ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesnt continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . as guidance counsellor edward french ,   friend   schwimmer also deserves mention . he wants to be the parent to todd that todds own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupils blackening-heart even more apparent . but one of the films ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the   right   or the   wrong   choices . schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible ."

,   "description"  :   "starring denzel washington , john hannah , live schreiber , deborah kara unger , viscellous reon shannon , dan hedaya , harris yulin , david paymer , clancy brown , and rod steiger . directed by norman jewison written by armayan bernstein and dan gordon denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washingtons very best to date . he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting   the hurricane   a much better film than it actually is . when his rubin   hurricane   carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in americas history . he is that amazing . the problem with   the hurricane   is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . this is , without a doubt , washingtons movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . carters second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carters book in the 1980s , that a serious battle for freedom took place . the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . the devastation in washingtons eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . his anger is heightened to a point of no control . we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . we see an emotional boxing match inside carters head . from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . he realizes that society is changing . that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . if only the other actors had this same determination . dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . it felt like his character was taken straight out of a   scooby doo   episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasnt for those annoying little kids .   the kids   in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in   shawshank redemption   ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in   clueless ,   same for david paymer in   get shorty ,   harris yulin in   ghostbusters   and liev schreiber in   the daytrippers .   it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin   hurricane   carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get ."

,   "description"  : "marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979s alien and 1986s aliens , savaged david finchers slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . what could be next ? whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also   infected   with alien dna . so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately , that is where alien resurrections clever streak in writing stops . the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . as technically adept as jeunets direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedons ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scotts alien or the even greater film that james camerons aliens was . but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of finchers alien3 , jeunets resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments ."

,   "description"  :   "warning : may contain slight mild spoilers . rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language . starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne . we go into a movie theater , boom ! the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie weve been waiting to see for a long time comes on . we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is . why shouldnt i have know what i was getting myself into . again like this past summers hit   stigmata   ,   end of days   may be worse . its not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some   rosemarys baby   , along with   the devils advocate   a little   exorcist   and some   stigmata   here and there . whala you have   end of days   a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific . sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers . the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next . jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist . he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely hes trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes . he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending thats satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie . thats pretty much it on plot . it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went . as for arnie ? good role , ok performance . i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts . the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film . in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions . gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in   stigmata   ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character . two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun   the devils advocate   and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also . robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satans main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child . of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isnt nothing new . the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in   stigmata   . here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just dont work in this movie . the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home . only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product dont work as well . the sad thing is that   end of days   had so many things going for it . the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing . at times it seems like   armageddon   and started to get old and tiresome . hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like ive always said before needs new ones . even with its 100m budget   end of days   is less than pleasing . in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget"

,   "description"  :  " the marketers of hudson hawk obviously have a lot more talent than the filmmakers . misguided and miscalculated on every conceivable level , hudson hawk is the most lame-brained , stupefyingly awful movie to have come around in a long time . director michael lehmann ( heathers ) has taken a promising idea and turned it into a mind-boggling misfire , a sorry spectacle of a film that even the most die hard bruce willis fans will abhor . the movies wooden and empty-headed plot revolves around master cat burglar eddie   hudson hawk ,   played by willis . hes hired to steal three priceless da vinci artifacts by a variety of odious villains -- the mario brothers , george kaplan and the candy bars , and a pair of kinky and colorful miscreants , darwin and minerva mayflower ( played to the hilt by richard e . grant and sandra bernhard ) . the plan is to unlock the secrets of leonardos puzzle , three rubiks cube-like crystals which , when put together correctly , are said to provide instant wealth and gratification . pity the same couldnt be said of the film . the hawk is aided and abetted by long time partner-in-crime and confidante tommy five-tone ( danny aiello of do the right thing ) . they get to perform a couple of gratuitously surreal musical numbers together , which shows you just how low this film will sink in order to get a laugh . andie macdowell ( sex , lies and videotape ) plays willis love interest , anna baragli . lovely , yes , but interesting ? not in this movie . you know where the films heading when it manages to poke fun at asians , the handicapped and overweight people all within the first five minutes . by its long overdue conclusion , everyone else in between -- including the audience -- has been insulted . the best thing in the film are the mayflowers , who resemble characters in a john waters movie . bernhard has a field day in her role as minerva , a garishly outfitted , rubber-faced dominatrix who gets off on psychologically ridiculing the mawkish hawk . her performance is hideously over the top , but thats what makes it all the more fun to watch . and grants despotic darwin delivers what few funny lines there are in the film . waters , the director of such sleazoid epics as pink flamingos and polyester , has said that bad taste is what entertainment is all about . but in hudson hawk , lehmann abuses the privilege . apparently the film had more than its fair share of production problems , discernible from the opening credits . willis -- who must take a large part of the blame for this embarrassment -- co-wrote the story with executive producer robert kraft . kraft , in turn , shares screen credit with composer michael kamen ( die hard and the   lethal weapon   series ) . kamen was supposedly still working on the score days before the film was released . and it shows . the sound , too , is so bad you cant often hear what the characters are saying . and the film is poorly edited -- some snatches of footage are so short youre not quite sure what you are supposed to have seen . all this in a movie reputed to have cost upwards of $75 million !"

,   "description"  :   "if someone had told me that a movie starring richard gere and sharon stone as a married couple would be low-quality , boring , unsexy , and incongruous in every way , id have laughed in his face . know what ? intersection is everything ive just mentioned . gere stars as vincent eastman , a successful architect who runs a joint business with wife sherry , played by sharon stone . vincent is absolutely unhappy with his life and marriage , as he tells a friend ,   we werent a family . we were a corporation with a daughter .   its easy to see why vincent would want to leave his wife for another woman , the sensual red-head olivia ( played by lolita davidovich ) . hes obviously very in love with his mistress ; vincent plans to build a new home for them , get married , and have children soon thereafter . a terrific beginning . a wonderful set-up . we see vincent driving along a slick road after a rain storm at high speed , letter in hand , smiling . what about ? without giving too much away , during the opening moments of the film , geres character has made an important decision regarding what hes going to do with the rest of his life . hes on his way in that direction when he slams on the brakes and plows into three different cars before tumbling his own vehicle off the side of the road . thats the story . that and that only . what fills the remaining eighty minutes of the film is flashbacks , lots of them . we see gere with his wife at home and in the office . we see gere with his daughter , gere with work associates , and gere with his mistress . flashbacks and flashbacks . flashbacks intertwined and within one another . after a while its difficult to tell whether or not anything is actually happening at the time we are watching , in the present . and its even more difficult to give a damn . this is one hell of a free-form movie . thats fine , if thats the way you want to go with the material , so long as you weed out the unnecessary from the . . . well , in the case of this film . . . not-so unnecessary . give it all some meaning , at least . thats what i would have done , anyway . unfortunately i wasnt in charge of production . i would like to say that intersection is about the memories of a dying man ; the memories of him and the woman he truly loves , and why he wants to be with her and her alone . i cant say it . even when were sure he loves her , we arent quite positive . id love to say that this movie will entertain you in some fashion , but i cant . what i can say of intersection is that it was almost a complete waste of my time . anything else i could say would be a waste of yours .

( just to make an idle point , i did like   toy story ,   but that was good ) also , i have this aversion to bad french farces , and if they remake them into american films . well , this is my excuse : it was prom night , im not a prom person , my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive-ins where they were playing   grosse pointe blank   - wouldnt mind seeing it again - but i had to suffer through this first . i agreed to go . ugh . in all fairness , i can say that at least this inane plot wasnt dreamed by an american . it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of   little indian , big city   ( french title -   un indien dans la ville   ) . i stayed away from it like it was limburgher , and according to roger ebert , that was a good idea . but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement . the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage . let me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago , and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something . he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this . . . thing ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch , who is usually good ) . she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off . he meets him , he has a weird name ( mimi seku , i think . . . or as the bad joke goes -   mitsubishi   - laugh track cue ) , he knows english , they fish , more bad jokes , pirhanna joke , the kid has a pet spider , he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty . . . you know the drill . now this is where the plot complicates ( well , complicates for this one , at least ) : the fish-out-of-water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city . tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasnt able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - martin short . a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere ( how come in every hokey french import , there is a mob ? ! ) tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries . the story is crap , the jokes are hokey and not really funny , and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting . but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldnt help it . the whole time , i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this . at the end of filming , did they all scream out ,   weve made a great movie , guys !   i sure hope not . big question to get from this film : why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if theyre just going to do it the exact same way ? huh ? my rating ( out of 5 ) : ( for some of the actors names and a joke or two that made me chuckle , i guess . . . okay , so i really feel bad for it , so i only gave it one star )"

,   "description"  :   "starring antonio banderas and sir anthony hopkins . directed by martin campbell . running time : 2 hours 15 minutes swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . however , hes far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . banderas motive ? to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorros , playing each other off with ease . hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . the audience does hate them , which cant be bad . catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . theres a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well . the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding . although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and theres barely a dull moment . however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . although theyve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . theres lots of little sub plots hanging around , but theres nothing substantial to bring them all together . the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to buy california using gold stolen from the guy hes buying the land off . this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . however , this doesnt seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where its going . in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . you wont regret it ."

,   "description"  :  "capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyones taste . rating : 9 ( 0 to 10 ) , + 3 ( -4 to + 4 ) more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . certainly there was david leans the bridge on the river kwai . there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . then there were tv series   a town like alice   and   tenko .   lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . beating and torture are commonplace events . men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to groups norms is all that gives a life meaning . conformity is purpose . before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . it is neither . it is a stirring and believable account of camp life . the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . this serves a double purpose for cunningham . it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . it also creates a distancing effect . the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 3 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

its about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure – there is no real beginning or end . instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships – male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin . we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . there is comedy and tragedy . most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives – in this fiction can be found much truth . the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . its so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guests focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . these two have a stormy relationship . they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . frances adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things dont go exactly as planned . lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . it doesnt matter whether or not they knew the deceased . its the ceremony that theyre interested in . sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . the acting is strong and believable . the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . four of the films principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . the rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickmans microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater ."

,   "description"  :  " directed by mimi leder starring george clooney , nicole kidman , armin-mueller stahl , michael lures , randall batinkoff , michael boatman mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . her mast famous episode ,   loves labour lost   , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywoods big blockbuster movies . so its only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint . peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent . its long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off . george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly . the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . this is when leder starts to show her true stuff . she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer . then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york citys crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them . mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense . she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking . nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero . youre not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . george clooney is a real movie star . many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real . he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality . hell be around for a while . dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .

,   "description"  :  "scream   directed by wes craven . written by kevin williamson . starring neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette . only a year after the initial release of  scream  the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel  scream 2  has arrived in our theaters . while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , its really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . the premise of  scream 2  is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called  stab ,  based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in scream ,  is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think its a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . the satire in  scream 2  thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . everything from  friends  and  saved by the bell  to  showgirls  and  terminator 2  is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there arent any  wes carpenter  jokes this time . more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from  scream  ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroines life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . understandably ,  scream 2  does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right .

,   "description"  :   "directed by mimi leder starring george clooney , nicole kidman , armin-mueller stahl , michael lures , randall batinkoff , michael boatman mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . her mast famous episode , loves labour lost  , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywoods big blockbuster movies . so its only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint . peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent . its long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off . george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly . the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . this is when leder starts to show her true stuff . she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer . then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york citys crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them . mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense . she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking . nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero . youre not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . george clooney is a real movie star . many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real . he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality . hell be around for a while . dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .

,   "description"  :  "starring : arthur hill ( dr . jeremy stone ) , david wayne ( dr . charles dutton ) , james olson ( dr . mark hall ) , kate reid ( dr . ruth leavitt ) . produced and directed by robert wise . the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . i know that is very sweeping statement , so ill qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of  science fiction ,  stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . something bad happens to them . pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . apparently everyone in the town is dead . the authorities call a  wildfire alert ,  summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a  directive 712 ,  an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . they barely call off the bombing in time . but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . this triggers the labs last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we dont expect . this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a bodys wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood ."

,   "description"  :  "lili taylor nabbed one of her first lead roles in this truue life drama about valerie jean solanas , the woman who shot andy warhol in 1968 . but the film is more of a showcase to the ways of the 60s and the influence that warhol and other artists had on the people at that time . valerie jean solanas ( taylor ) is a lesbian feminist who as written a book called scum manifesto , a book ( which is now a classic ) about the way that men ( like disease , or so she says ) have been ruling here for the millions of years before us . she tries to sell it on the street , and is thrilled when her drag queen friend is invited to andy warhols pad . this is her chance to sell him not only on the book , but on some plays that she has been writing . but andy is just like all of the other men out there . when a publisher signs her to a fraud contract and a friend puts her on a television show discussing homosexuality where the host makes fun of her , she begins to think that andy is all behind it . hes been constantly ignoring and making fun of her and she doesnt like it . her increasing rage is about to bring on the deadliest of consequences . lili taylor gives the performance of her career ( at least so far ) she puts every ounce that she can into this character and its a great treat to watch . flaws are abound however , most of the film is boring and needs something interesting to be put on the screen and the story was told harsher than it needs to be . still , the film does a good job of examining the inner rage that overcame the woman and her actions thereafter . if your looking for a cool 60s noir piece , rent i shot andy warhol , which gets * * * stars . the young-uns : the main character is lesbian and we see one lesbian encounter . she is also a prostitute and we see two ( not very explicit ) sex scenes of her servicing her customers . it also contains strong language and drug use "

,   "description"  :  "as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous . almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america . so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . it has been done before with varying results . this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . . unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . the ‘prince , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets cinderella , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women . although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . but , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . all in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land . but , dont get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing"

,   "description"  :  "i didnt read mitch alboms book , tuesdays with morrie , which spent about two jillion years on the bestseller lists . but based on the movie , i can see why so many people bought the book and why its ripe for criticism . as brandeis university professor morrie schwartzs body deteriorated from lou gehrigs disease , former student albom decided to record the mans thoughts on an array of topics . if the movie is anything like the book , then morrie sounds like the worlds foremost pop psychologist . and thats part of the problem i had watching the adaptation . albom claims that morrie was  a force in the classroom , but he gets stuck saying things like  once you learn how to die , you learn how to live .  albom is certainly a happier person for having talked to his teacher , but i get the feeling he could have rented old yeller or watched a few self-help infomercials and came out ok . sarcastic comments aside , i cant fault a made-for-tv movie that has sturdy , sensitive performances and good intentions . if i can be taught about the values of life and not want to smack any of the characters upside the head , then the movie cant be all that bad . hank azaria ( the birdcage ) plays albom , a work-obsessed detroit sportswriter who is constantly on the go . his world stops when he sees a news special profiling morries condition . some 15 years after promising to keep in touch and not doing so , albom decides to visit his professor . pretty soon , they regularly meet on tuesdays--morries old office hours . jack lemmon plays morrie , a man whose indomitable spirit is still whole regardless of the medical obstacles he faces . its a role that could have been played like a geriatric patch adams , but lemmon ( one of the best actors of his generation ) handles the role with grace . azaria , always an undervalued actor , does a good job and even sounds a bit like albom , a regular on espn . azaria has always had a slightly cynical streak to him that makes him more human . that trait serves him especially well in this occasionally sudsy , but overall entertaining fare ."

,  "description" : "based on the laura zigman novel , animal husbandry , someone like you is a romantic comedy about a late night tv talent coordinator named jane ( ashley judd ) , whose luck in love is predictably bad . so predictable is her misfortune , in fact , that she has devised a pervasive theory on the subject , revolving around the notion that men are like cattle . when she meets her show s new executive , ray ( kinnear , you ve got mail ) , however , her luck -- she thinks -- begins to change . but ray , she discovers , is just a typical bull , looking to spread his seed in wider pastures . and it s not until he dumps her for his ex-girlfriend that she realizes the true depth of her plight . jane , it seems , is an old cow . and ray is looking for a new cow . this joke more or less carries the film , and -- though interesting at first -- it gets old after its twentieth or fiftieth appearance in the script . fortunately , though , the film s fresh , funny dialogue packs enough power to keep things interesting . and the wry , cynical performance of hugh jackman ( x-men ) as the incorrigibly good-timing eddie drops in just in time to prevent the entire film from degenerating into a ridiculously softball piece of fluff . these combine with quick , quirky editing to provide enough stimuli to keep most audiences alert for this sub two-hour picture . those needing a little more stimulation than that ( men , mostly ) should take heart in the fact that ashley s underpants scene from the movie s trailer is served justly on the big screen . ( though anyone looking for world-class cheerleading sequences will be saddened to learn that judd s jumping splits performance was ruined by her inability to keep both legs straight in midair . for the record , this didn t bother me a bit . ) judd carries her role with a meg ryan-esque charm that should prove valuable in future productions , while jackman proves he has all the qualities of a rugged , enviable leading man . the supporting cast is funny , and well placed , as well -- particularly ellen barkin as the host of the late night show . much to my surprise , someone like you made for a funny , enjoyable picture right up until its final moments , when it completely brained itself by falling into the usual rut of romantic comedy conclusions . with its richness of dialogue and editing , i was certain it might have overcome its genre to set some new precedent in romantic comedy cheese . but no . in the end , this is still a warm , fuzzy picture with enough wit to satisfy most audiences in need of a laugh . ladies : go for the humor . gents : stay for the underpants .

,  "description" : " i ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . the part of jeff   the dude   lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . he s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . the dude assumes that these   collection agents   were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . it s not what they do that s funny , it s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that s jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as   vaginal ;   steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . they sound natural . taken with fargo , the coen brothers  last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he s also good at technical directing . he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . perhaps   beautiful   is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . outstanding acting"

,  "description" : "the haunting  -a review by bill chambers ( haunting@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring lili taylor , liam neeson , catherine zeta-jones , owen wilson screenplay by david self , based on the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson directed by jan de bont   some houses are born bad ,   goes the haunting s tag line , to which i must add ,   some movies , too .   nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson s meritorious novel . the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout   boo .   fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . marrow s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house s bleak history . he s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor s previous inhabitants . taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we re introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn t just ditch this bitch . as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . unfortunately , she s saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . theo s assessment of the house ?   i love it ! sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters .   who on earth would say that in place of   citizen kane meets the munsters   ? ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland . as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old   academic bait and switch   on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he s accused . later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it s amusing to hear neeson shout   nell   repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still . i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire s harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson s the frighteners . i don t mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he s a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills .
